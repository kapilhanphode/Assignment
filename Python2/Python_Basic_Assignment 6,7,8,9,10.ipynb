    "## 1.What are Escape characters ? and how do you use them ?\n",

    "### example: \\t, \\n\n",

    "## 2.What do the escape characters n and t stand for ?\n",

    "## 1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "### Ans: No, PyInputPlus is not a part of Python Standard Library, it needs to be installed explicitly using the command !pip install PyInputPlus\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n",
    "### Ans: You can import the module with import pyinputplus as pyip so that you can enter a shorter name when calling the module's functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "### Ans: inputInt() function Accepts an integer value. This also takes additional parameters min, max, greaterThan and lessThan for bounds. And it always returns an int.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whereas inputFloat() function Accepts a floating-point numeric value. this also takes additional min, max, greaterThan and lessThan parameters. and always returns a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "### Ans: PyInputPlus module provides a function called as inputInt() which only returns only integer values. inorder to restrict the input between 0 and 99, i'ii use parameters like min & max to ensure that user enters the values between the defined range only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "### wholenumber = pyip.inputInt(prompt='Enter a number: ', min=0, max=100)\n",
    "### print(wholenumber)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "### Ans: we can use allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments to take list of regular expression strings to determine what the pyinputplus function will reject or accept valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "### Ans: The statement inputStr(limit=3) will throw two exceptions ValidationException and RetryLimitException. The first exception is thrown because blank values are not allowed by inputStr() function by default. it we want to consider blank values as valid input, we have to set blank=True.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second exception is occured because we have reached the max limit we have specified by using limit parameter. inorder to avoid this exception we can use default parameter to return a default value when max limit is reached."

    "## 1.To what does a relative path refer ?\n",
    "### Ans: The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).\n",
    "### For example: if Absolute path to a file called stuff.txt is: C:/users/admin/docs/stuff.txt If my PWD is C:/users/admin/ , then the relative path to stuff.txt would be: docs/stuff.txt\n",
    "### Note: PWD + relative path = absolute path\n",

    "## 2.Where does an absolute path start with your Operating System ?\n",
    "### Ans: In Linux based systems the absolute path starts with /. Where as in Windows based systems absolute path starts with C:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.What does the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do ?\n",
    "### Ans: os.getcwd() method tells us the location of current working directory (CWD). Whereas os.chdir() method in Python used to change the current working directory to specified path. These functions are similar to linux commands pwd and cd"

    "## 6.What are the three mode arguments that can be passed to the open() function ?\n",
    "### Ans: A file can be Accessed in python using open() function. open function takes two arguments filename and mode of operation (optional). if mode is not provided the default mode of opening is read mode\n",
    "### So, the syntax being: open(filename, mode)\n",
    "### ‘r’ – Read Mode: This is the default mode for open(). The file is opened and a pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file’s content.\n",
    "### ‘w’ – Write Mode: Using this mode will overwrite any existing content in a file. If the given file does not exist, a new one will be created.\n",
    "### ‘r+’ – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n",
    "### ‘a’ – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file.\n",
    "### ‘a+’ – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",
    "### ‘x’ – Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files. Use this mode if you know the file to be written doesn’t exist beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode ?\n",
    "### Ans: Using this mode will overwrite any existing content in a file. If the given file does not exist, a new one will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines() ?\n",
    "### Ans: The main difference is that read() will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whereas the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis. You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM.\n",
    "### The read() would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
    "### The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.What data structure does a shelf value resemble ?\n",
    "### Ans: it contains key and values it represents dictionary."

    "## 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "### Ans: shutil.copy() method is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primary takes two arguments src,dest, src represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file/folder to where the src data should be copied, if dest is a folder name the src with exact name will be copied to the dest folder, if its a file then the contents of src will be copied to dest where dest retains it name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### shutil.copytree() function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes two arguments src & dest, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. the important catch here is dest must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with shutil.copystat() and individual files are copied using shutil.copy2() by default which can be modified using copy_function attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "### Ans: os.rename() function is used to rename files or directories using a python program, this function takes two arguments src and dest, src represents the name file/directory which we want to rename, whereas dest represents the new name of the file/directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "### Ans: Shutil module provides a funciton called as shutil.rmtree() which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are os.remove() -> removes a file, os.rmdir() removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where as send2trash module provides a function called send2trash.send2trash() to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if is deleted using the send2trash.send2trash() function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules. it needs to be installed explicitly using the command !pip install send2trash\n",

    "## 4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "### Ans: ZipFile Module provides a method called as zipfile.ZipFile() to read and write to zipFiles. it takes arugments lile filename and mode etc zipfile.ZipFile('filename', mode = 'r')\n",
