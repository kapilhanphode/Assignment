    "### Ans: The def statement defines a function\n",
    "### Syntax of Function:\n",
    "### def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "###    \"\"\"doc string\"\"\"          \n",

    "###    -----function body-----\n",
    "###    return value\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "### Ans: A function is procedure to achieve a particular result. while function call is using this function to achive that task. Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "### Ans: There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "### Ans: When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "### Ans: A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "### Ans: If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "### Ans: A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "### Ans: The data type of None is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "### Ans: That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "### Ans: This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "### Ans: Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause and use except block to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "### Ans:The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause. The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause."
